Hi! I'm Scott. I made this webpage mostly to share my interest in data science and some visualizations that I make. I'm pretty interested in rigorous data analysis, as graduate school and [How to lie with statistics](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/cc/zhangyf/papers/How-to-Lie-with-Statistics.pdf) taught me that it's easy to make misleading claims from data. And we can use the same data to come to opposite conclusions.

I'm now a data scientist working to counteract attempted fraud. I transitioned into the field through the [Insight data science fellowship program](https://www.insightdatascience.com/). Previously, I was a graduate student in [neuroscience at UC San Diego](http://healthsciences.ucsd.edu/education/neurograd/Pages/default.aspx) working in the [Voytek lab](https://voyteklab.com) studying brain rhythms. Specifically, I developed a new analysis framework to extract additional information from neural signals by parametrizing the waveform shapes of the brain rhythms. You can learn more about our motivations in this [review paper](http://www.pemft.net/uploads/1/6/2/3/1623943/brain_oscillations_and_the_importance_of_waveform_shape.pdf) and the techniques in this [methods paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/16/302000).
