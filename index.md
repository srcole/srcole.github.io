I'm Scott. I use this webpage mostly to share my thoughts and interests, mostly involving data science. I'm pretty interested in rigorous data analysis, as graduate school and [How to lie with statistics](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/cc/zhangyf/papers/How-to-Lie-with-Statistics.pdf) taught me that it's too easy to make misleading claims from data and use the same data to justify opposite conclusions.

I'm now a data scientist working in fraud prevention. I transitioned into this through the [Insight data science fellowship program](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) and previously was a graduate student in [neuroscience at UC San Diego](http://healthsciences.ucsd.edu/education/neurograd/Pages/default.aspx) derping around in the [Voytek lab](https://voyteklab.com) studying brain waves. Specifically, I developed a new analysis framework to extract additional information from neural signals by parametrizing the waveform shapes, as represented best in [this review paper](http://www.pemft.net/uploads/1/6/2/3/1623943/brain_oscillations_and_the_importance_of_waveform_shape.pdf) and [this methods paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/16/302000).
