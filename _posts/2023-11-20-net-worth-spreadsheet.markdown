A lot of nerds have spreadsheets to track the details of their financials because commercial finance tracking apps can't always be as customizable as desired. I, of course, am proud of [my own net worth tracking spreadsheet template here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t6SkBjQQAcL72asyFrE_1PGjuoLjqzFT6PaUC4XFXAU/edit?usp=sharing). As seen in that sheet or in the screenshot below, some of my favorite features are:
- Computing the breakdown of each asset class
- Quantifying the impact of inflation
- Accounting for tax obligations in both the current and future years
- Calculate statistics of change over multiple time windows
- Measure how much of an impact investing has had on net worth
