A lot of nerds have spreadsheets to track the details of their financials because commercial finance tracking apps can't always be as customizable as desired. While there are ton of blogs detailing Excel sheets full of fancy features in a tuned aesthetic, I, of course, am proud of [my own net worth tracking Google spreadsheet template here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t6SkBjQQAcL72asyFrE_1PGjuoLjqzFT6PaUC4XFXAU/edit?usp=sharing). As seen in that sheet or in the screenshot below, some of my favorite features of this sheet are:
- Computing the breakdown of each asset class
- Quantifying the impact of inflation
- Accounting for tax obligations in both the current and future years
- Calculate statistics of change over multiple time windows
- Measure how much of an impact investing has had on net worth

Curious to hear about others spreadsheets and potential ideas for how to enhance my own!
