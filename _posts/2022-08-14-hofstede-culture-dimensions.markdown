Freakonomics had a recent episode, [The Pros and Cons of Americaâ€™s (Extreme) Individualism](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-pros-and-cons-of-americas-extreme-individualism-ep-470-2/), which described an [interesting framework of 6 culture dimensions defined by Hofstede](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_66.htm). The 6 culture dimensions are:
- Power Distance Index
- Individualism v. Collectivism
- Masculinity v. Femininity
- Uncertainty Avoidance Index
- Long- v. Short-Term Orientation
- Indulgence v. Restraint

I wanted to explore this more, so I downloaded the data of these dimension ratings by country and made [this Streamlit app](https://srcole-streamlit-hofstede-dimensions-app-lxprgu.streamlitapp.com/). I was interested in seeing how similar my preferences would be to different countries to get a sense of which countries may have the most compatible culture to me.

Personally, it looks like I'm closely aligned with Northern Europe, as I prefer:
- Lower power distance
- More individualism
- Less masculinity
- Lower uncertainty avoidance
- Long-term orientation
- More indulgence

I hope you enjoy playing around [with the Streamlit app here](https://srcole-streamlit-hofstede-dimensions-app-lxprgu.streamlitapp.com/).
