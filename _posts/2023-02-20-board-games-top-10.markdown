I recently listened to [Board Game Barrage’s top 50 games of all time podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9ib2FyZGdhbWViYXJyYWdlLmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz/episode/NDNjNjNkM2ItNGVkYS00ODg4LWE5YTktMjk3NzFiYzgxOTcy?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjjw_uoiOv8AhV2DkQIHdi4BIMQjrkEegQIJxAF&ep=6), and it made me want to define my own top board game list of my favorites. But 50 is too many, so I’ll stick with 10 and some honorable mentions.

### 1. Charterstone
[2017, 2-6 players, BoardGameGeek overall ranking #438](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/197376/charterstone)
- I love legacy games and how this game introduced more elements in each of the 12 sessions
- I mostly like euro style games, defined by Wikipedia as having indirect player interaction and abstract physical components, and less luck, conflict, and drama as American games. So I really enjoyed the victory point optimization here too
- I played through with 6 people, and agree with BGG it’s likely best, if you can put together a group that can commit to it.

### 2. The Crew
[2019, 2-5 players, BGG #53](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284083/crew-quest-planet-nine)
- I played a lot of Spades growing up, so I’m a bit biased towards trick-taking games with trump suits. In Spades, I really liked collaborating with a partner, so Crew being a fully collaborative trick-taking game, I think is a lot of fun.
- Like BGG says, this feels best with 4 players. I’ve played a lot with 2 players (and a robot simulated player), and that’s still fun.

### 3. Pandemic Legacy
[2015, 2-4 players, BGG #3](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1)
- I’ve played seasons 1&2 of Pandemic Legacy, and both times we’ve sprinted through the whole game in less than a week because it was exciting to see what’s going to get revealed.
- Says it’s best with 4 people, but I’ve only played with 2, and it’s still ranked high for me.

### 4. Power Grid
[2004, 2-6 players, BGG #54](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid)
- For a while, Power Grid was my favorite game to play. Probably because I love auctions and the race to reach the victory point threshold.
- I’ve mainly played with 4-6 people, and I like being able to have as much of the map open as possible, so I imagine I wouldn’t be as excited about 2-3 players.

### 5. Isle of Sky
[2015, 2-5 players, BGG #237](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176494/isle-skye-chieftain-king)
- I’m really surprised this game isn’t more popular because it’s a fun victory-point-soup game that is still easy to explain and onboard friends who aren’t big strategy gamers fairly quickly.
- Another auction game, and this one I think has the fun tradeoff between how much I want your tile vs. how much I don’t want to give you too much money.

### 6. Trajan
[2011, 2-4 players, BGG #111](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102680/trajan)
- I went through a phase of playing a lot of Trajan because I really enjoyed the combination of ways to get victory points.
- The mancala mechanism of choosing your action is unique and adds a really fun twist.

### 7. Biblios
[2007, 2-4 players, BGG #420](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34219/biblios)
- Biblios is my go-to competitive game for my non-board-gamer friends. It can be pretty quick to explain: 5-10min
- There’s more luck in this game than I would generally like, but that’s fine so the beginners have more of a chance of winning.
- Auction is the main mechanism here, so I like that. I also enjoy the optimization to try to win the very limited victory points.

### 8. Escape: The Curse of the temple
[2012, 1-5 players, BGG #645](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/113294/escape-curse-temple)
- I have vague but good memories of playing Escape. It’s a real-time, dice-rolling, collaborative game. The stress of trying to roll the right combination of dice faces to accomplish the tasks in time is fun.

### 9. Wingspan
[2019, 1-5 players, BGG #26](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan)
- The main reason I like Wingspan is because it’s evidently really popular among my board gaming friends, so a bunch of them own it and want to play it, so I’ve gotten quite a few reps in recently.
- And, as usual, I like victory-point-soup games.

### 10. Evolution: Climate
[2016, 2-6 players, BGG #367](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182134/evolution-climate)
- I really enjoyed building up new species in Evolution, but I’d get a bit upset when they’d die or get eaten by someone else’s carnivore.
- I never played the base game of Evolution, but I’d likely enjoy that even more, since I tend to like simplicity rather than expansions.
