Oakland and Berkeley have a lot of neighborhoods with nice streets lined with trees that produce fruits like lemons, mandarins, and figs. I've recently gotten obsessed with [collecting a map of them](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1ErfbvNV15pLroZwZ97NzqUYa8vF8xAU&usp=sharing).

Picking fruit off a stranger's tree can be a contentious idea that some of my friends have gawked at. So I also made the flow chart below to formally decide if it's OK to pick the fruit from a tree.
