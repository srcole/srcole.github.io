Riding the metro in Mexico City, I was struck by how briefly their doors open at the stops. So I began measuring the number of seconds the doors remained open, and I repeated the measurement in San Francisco over the course of a month to collect the data shown below.

It is clear that the doors of the metro in Mexico City are open much more briefly than in San Francisco (medians: 10s vs. 28s).

### Data collection methodology

A Google Pixel 3 with Google Sheets was installed for easy data entry. At each new stop, immediately after the doors began to open, I looked at a Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro 3 and noted the time, in seconds-resolution. By repeating this process after the soors began to close, the difference was recorded as the number of seconds the doors were open at that stop into this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kkpbr0-V_IrsJvXUU5q6A7tsmhUxP02Bj3-C4KWcIrA/edit?usp=sharing).
