I got my mail-in ballot today and remembered how itâ€™s really difficult and time-consuming to have an informed opinion on everything that we vote for (other than Presidential candidate). So I spent time finding some resources on each election and proposition and wanted to share the resources so that others can inform their votes more easily!

Below I provide some resources (and bold my preferences) for each of the elections:

### United States Representative, District 12
